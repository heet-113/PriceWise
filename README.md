- **Real-Time Web Scraping**: Fetches live data to ensure pricing accuracy.
- **In-Memory Caching**: Minimizes redundant scraping requests and speeds up search times and rate limits.


## Tech Stack

**Frontend**:
- React 19
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Zustand (State Management)
- React Router DOM

**Backend**:
- Node.js
- Express
- Axios (HTTP client for fetching HTML)
- Cheerio (HTML parsing and scraping)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd "New folder"
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Backend Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

You will need to run both the backend server and the frontend development server simultaneously.

**Start the Backend Server**:
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```
The scraping server will run on `http://localhost:3001`.

**Start the Frontend Server**:
Open a new terminal window/tab:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The React app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Deployment on Render

This project is configured to be easily deployed as a single Web Service on [Render](https://render.com/).

1. Create a new **Web Service** on Render and connect your repository.
2. Configure the service with the following settings:
   - **Environment**: `Node`
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build:render`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
3. Add any necessary environment variables (e.g., `PORT` is automatically provided by Render).
4. Click **Deploy Web Service**. Render will install dependencies, build the frontend, and start the unified Express server serving both the API and the static React app.

## API Endpoints

The backend Express server exposes the following main endpoints:

- `GET /api/search?q=<search_term>`: Scrapes and returns price comparison results for the given search query across all supported platforms.
- `GET /api/featured`: Fetches products for featured category sections displayed on the homepage.
- `GET /api/health`: Returns the server status, caching metrics, and uptime.
- `GET /api/cache/clear`: Clears the in-memory scraper cache.
